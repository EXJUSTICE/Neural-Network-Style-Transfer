# Neural-Network-Style-Transfer
VGG trained covnet code for transferring styles over to a reference image, to create unique artworks.

NST uses a trained Neural Network to take target image and a reference image, and produce an output which retains both the content of the target image along with the style of the reference image. Replace the style and target images in order to create your own projects.
Utilizes Python, KERAS & Tensorflow.
